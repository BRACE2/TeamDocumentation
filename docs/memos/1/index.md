# Memo 1: Web Security Concerns for the First MotionAPI Beta-Release

This memo collects various resources concerning web security, and
lays a foundation for the security of the MotionAPI developed for the
BRACE2 project.

The MotionAPI currently uses JWT authentication tokens that are created
in-house and tightly controlled.

The following resources may be useful for further assessing the security
of the MotionAPI and other web services which may be incorporated into 
the BRACE2 project.
