## Tools

The following tools are being developed as part of the BRACE2 project.

[MotionAPI](tools/MotionAPI)
:  Ground motion management system.

[PyG3](tools/pyg3)
:  High-level threadsafe bindings to the OpenSees framework.

[QuakeIO](tools/quakeio/) 
:  A library of utilities for parsing ground motion files.

Each tool has been designed to closely follow best practices for their

design and use is being developed in order to support a maintainable
code base.

All tools maintain an associated set of validation and verification tests which are
integrated into a continuous integration workflow.
*Continuous Integration* refers to...
