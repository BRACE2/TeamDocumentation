# Survey of Methods for System Identification

Single Input-Single Output (SISO) discrete filter modeling is covered first, subsequently, 
Multiple Input-Single Output (MISO) discrete time filters are presented.

- Transfer function modeling [@yalin2006 ;]

- State-Space formulations, OKID-ERA-DC, etc [@yalin2006]
  - System Realization by Information Matrix (SRIM)
  - Observer Kalman Filter Identification-Eigen Realization Algorithm with Direct Correlations (OKID-ERA-DC),
      - Detailed coverage of OKID-ERA can be found in Juang (1994)

## Transfer Function Modeling

### Non-Parametric Identification

(Bendat and Piersol, 1993) and (Ljung, 1997).
